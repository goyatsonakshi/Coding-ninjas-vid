}

// here we have a c as a and so c is a character
// then the ascii value of 100 is d from the ascii table that's why the output comes out to be d
// and we only have 4 bytes here so we add big number like 19920 in the value of a then it will only take the last digit as the input and will provide answer as ? only 
//this is called as typecasting putting values idhar udhar
