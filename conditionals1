    }
    
these all commented here below are different solutions and approaches to the same problem



 /*   if ( a== b) {
        cout << "Hey these are equal" << endl;
    }
        else {
            if ( a < b) {
                cout << "a is smaller" << endl;
            }
            else {
                cout << "a is greater" << endl;
            }
        }
}
    // this else the again if else is caled nested conditionals



/*  if ( a == b) {
        cout << "Hey these are equal" << endl;
    }
}



  /* if( a == b) {
        cout << "Hey these are equal" << endl;
    }
        else {
            cout << "These are not equal" << endl;
        }
    } */
